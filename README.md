# Feature-based-opinion-mining

### Need for this kind of project: ###
*	Since the evolution of social networks, people have started to express their opinions in the form of the blogs or facebook posts or tweets starting from the products people buy to the presidential candidate they support.
*	When searched for a particular product on the web, the current day search engines show the list of websites which gives the features of the product and their prices. But, the users can be given much more info about the product using the reviews about the searched product.
*	Thus, a new type of search engine can be designed which will not only retrieve facts, but will also enable the retrieval of opinions of the users about the product.

### Use cases ###
*   A search engine is created which, when searched for a product, gives the highlighted features of the product and some of the helpful reviews (instead of the user scrolling through all the reviews to know about the product).
*   Consider the scenario when the **product sellers** want to know which of their product features stood it in the market or which of their product features were not liked by majority of their users, this kind of analysis is very helpful.
